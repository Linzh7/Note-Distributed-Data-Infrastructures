From the perspective of practicality, a system cannot achieve all the three parts: correctness, latency and cost, namely, each project must have a trade-off between them. Therefore, disparate implementers are focused on different area, leading to different systems. Those systems, however, make problems more tricky by trying to give a specific solution. As authors mentioned, we should change our process approach for those problems, that is, give principled abstractions to allow users to make decisions on 

main motivations and system design aspects of the system presented in the paper.  

  

In addition to purely summarizing the article, put it into context with the rest of the systems we have seen in the course and discuss the respective pros and cons of them.
