[[Pregel]] as a distributed system, aims to process graph data. However, Pregel and its open source implements divide the whole graph into lots of partitions, which consider the vertexes as the keypoint of calculation. However, this method prevents future optimization algorithms from being applied to graphs. 

The authors of this paper believe graph-centric models can exist in parallel with the vertex-centered models. Additionally, graph-centric models have various benefits including lower level optimizations. Moreover, [[Pregel]] uses messages to update information between vertexes, which results the excessive amount of traffic. Additionally, GraphLab is struggling with maintaining the consistency, and the price is too much scheduling work. Giraph++ opened the structure of partitions to users, which can reduce the overhead by intra-partition communication. As a result, Giraph++ has a better performance.

Unlike [[Giraph]], Giraph++ gives the whole perspective of this subgraph to programmers. Each subgraph maintains the value of vertexes and edges. Moreover, a subgraph also includes boundary vertexes, but only maintains the vertexes themselves instead of both vertexes and edges. In this way, each subgraph can keep local copis of boundary vertexes and use those copies in order to pass messages to the primary copy. The distinction from internal vertices and boundary vertices is important, because it is an effective way to reduce the message exchange traffic. In this situation, the vertices do not have to update themselves until the next superstep. However, if it is a boundary vertex, the changes have made should be cast to the primary copy. An ideal partitioning approach can significantly reduced the number of edges which cross two subgraphs, and this will lead to
