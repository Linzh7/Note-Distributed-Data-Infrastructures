Hadoop is a distributed framework developed by Apache. There are a number of components are programmed for Hadoop and the core of any system is the storage, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). 

HDFS and other distributed file system use same strategies to organize storage space. They mark the manager computers as *NameNode* and storage computers as *DataNode*. All transmisions among computers are TCP, which could reduce the transmission error rate. The metadata stored at NameNode are the records of permission, date, namespace, etc., which are maintained at memory to increase the access speed. Also, these metadata have backups and logs to improve fault-tolerance. Additionally, NameNodes could also play another role in HDFS, 

The biggest difference between HDFS and other systems is that HDFS copies the same data to several DataNodes instead of protect data with RAID. That is a tread-off between data availability and available storage space. This strategy enables user access data from the closest DataNode without other transmisstion, which means it saves lots of bandwidth, the most important resources in the data warehouse. HDFS stores data in three different DataNodes by default. It is also worth to mention that the choice of three DataNodes. The first DataNodes and the second DataNodes is located at the same rack, while the third DataNodes should be located at a different rack. This strategy named *rack awareness policies* and it is aimed to improve the write performance and save bandwidth while not harm to fault-tolerance. Specifically, if one rack faces power problem, there still other copy(s) are available. The two copies on the same rack could reduce the traffic between racks, instead, they use ToR switch to copy data. Moreover, these policies also allow the NameNode distribute tasks to the cloest DataNode, which reduce the latency of compuing.

Another important policie is the communication between NameNodes and DataNodes. Beside the regular storage report from DataNodes, they also use heartbeats to make sure that DataNodes are still accessible. Moreover, NameNodes will not communicate to DataNodes dirctly, instead, NameNodes send information by replying heartbeats.
