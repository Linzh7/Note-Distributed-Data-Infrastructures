[Pregel: a system for large-scale graph processing](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1807184)

Graph plays an important role in science experiments, engineering computing and business analysis. For example, the Facebook social network is a graph. Nowadays, the amount of edges and vertices are growth in order of magnitude, which make the graph too big to be analyzed on a single computer. Moreover, large graph also is not easy to process, because it is hard to implement graph algorthms on distributed systems with fault tolerance. To address this problem, different organizations have different solutions, Google developed Pregel, and the success of Pregen led to Hadoop's Giraph.

To deploy graph computing on distributed system, the first problem should be solved is to propose a method could compuing as a chain instead of a network. This concept also appeared in MapReduce, named narrow dependency. In this case, Pregel use time series to record information, named *supersteps*. In each superstep, vertexes run a user defined function whose parameters are messages sent from other vertexes at the last superstep and send messages to other vertexes. Moreover, to reduce the processing time, the function in each superstep is parallelized. This is an intuitive solution, which is similar with MapReduce. Both of them are focus on the local tasks and ensure this distributed system is efficient. To deliver messages, a vertex could either read the value from remote nodes or the remote nodes send messages to this vertex. In practice, nodes in Pregel always send messages to other nodes to reduce the latency and enable asynchronously computing.

The termination of the algorithm is not based on the result, but on whether any vertex is still active. A vertex could vote to suspended itself, and also could be invoked by messages from other vertexes.


If we put Pregel in the context of previews systems, we can find lots of differences, but also lots of similarities. MapReduce could be used to solve graph problems, but those algorithms are not optimized for graph. Specifically, MapReduce process graph data by chained invocations, which will lead to extra communication overhead.
