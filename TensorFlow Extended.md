The engineering side of machine learning used to write custom codes to achieve goal, which leads to a lower code quality and redundant work and some potential vulnerabilities or hazards as results. Therefore, the people working in Google developed a platform which integrates components of machine learning system. However, the questions should be solved is not limited to code quality, the environment difference between training and production also could cause many kinds of failures. Besides, the commercial products also require lots of features, like stream training. Another important factor is the volume of models. Nowadays, the convolutional neural networks are tended to be too big to training on single computer, 





In the summary, focus on the main motivations and system design aspects of TFX.

In addition to purely summarizing the article, put it into context with the rest of the systems we have seen in the course and discuss the respective pros and cons of them.
