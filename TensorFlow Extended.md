The engineering side of machine learning used to write custom codes to achieve goal, which leads to a lower code quality and redundant work. In some case, those codes even lead to some potential vulnerabilities or hazards. Therefore, the people working in Google developed a platform which integrates components of machine learning system to reduce the repetitive work and improve the quality of code.



In the summary, focus on the main motivations and system design aspects of TFX.

In addition to purely summarizing the article, put it into context with the rest of the systems we have seen in the course and discuss the respective pros and cons of them.
