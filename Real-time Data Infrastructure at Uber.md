[Real-time Data Infrastructure at Uber](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448016.3457552)

Uber is a company provides vary fields services, and some of the services need to make decision in seconds. Moreover, Uber also wants to explore stream data to difference roles with a huge volume of data. Therefore, Uber refined Apache ecosystem to satisfy their requirements.

The structure of data processing system in Uber is a modified version of Apache. This is a hierarchical system, which could be broadly divided into four layers: storage, streaming, computing, analyze. 

There are two data types should be stored in this system, living streaming data and archival data from the whole system. The latter use [[HDFS]] to guarantee the fault-tolerance, meanwhile, the former use Kafka to provide streaming storage. Because data in PB , the processing system must support large scale. Therefore, Uber proposed cluster federation and dead letter queue.(addmore?)

The scale and workloads impact not only on storage, but also on steam processing. Though 


replaces the default failure handling mechanism in Kafka with dead letter queue which provides non-blocking retry to improve the traffic 

basic part, storage. To achieve the consistency, 

focus on how the overall system architecture is designed.Â   



Also, write about the various components, how they are integrated and contrast the lessons learned to what we have seen in the course.
