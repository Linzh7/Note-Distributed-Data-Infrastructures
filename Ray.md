[Ray: A Distributed Framework for Emerging AI Applications](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi18-moritz.pdf)

Nowadays, more and more tasks required an intelligent system which could react to the dynamic environments, reinforcement learning (RL) system. However, due to the features of RL and the 
varies in outcomes with different data, the framework must allow fine-grained calculations, and support heterogeneity in time and resource utilization. More In order to manage millions of diverse jobs per second with millisecond latencies, dynamic computation is another important 
feature for the framework.



focus on the main motivations and system design aspects of Ray


If we compare the exist framework with Ray, we can find that those frameworks 





In addition to purely summarizing the article, put it into context with the rest of the systems we have seen in the course and discuss the respective pros and cons of them.
