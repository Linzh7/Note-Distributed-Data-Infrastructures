[Ray: A Distributed Framework for Emerging AI Applications](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi18-moritz.pdf)

Nowadays, more and more tasks required an intelligent system which could react to the dynamic environments, reinforcement learning (RL) system. However, due to the features of RL, the framework is RL must allow fine-grained calculations, heterogeneity in time and resource utilization, and dynamic execution.

In order to manage millions of diverse jobs per second with millisecond latencies, we require a dynamic computation framework.



focus on the main motivations and system design aspects of Ray.




In addition to purely summarizing the article, put it into context with the rest of the systems we have seen in the course and discuss the respective pros and cons of them.
