In recent years, the volume of data increased rapidly. One of the results was the process of data became difficult. Specifically, we need computers to work as a cluster to deal with the data in order to complete tasks in time. The reason why this technique is appeared in Google is that only those companies need to finish tasks in a short time, in other words, they are sensitive with delay. As a result, to solve this problem, Google proposed a method named MapReduce, which enables to divide a huge task into many subtasks, in order to distribute those subtasks to work nodes from a low-level perspective. Moreover, those functions are easy to understand and implement, which means this framework reduces the threshold for big data processing. Additionally, It is worth to mention that a high-edge server is rare and expensive, whereas the common servers only have limited computing power to handle simple tasks. 

As the name shows, MapReduce can be divided into two parts, the Map function and the Reduce function. The intermediate link between these two parts are key-value pairs. Map function processes on the splitted data into key-value pairs, and Reduce function aggregate the pairs by key. This simple procedure is the high-level interface of MapReduce. Besides, there are still some highlight in the design. Because MapReduce is running on clusters, it should deal with failures properly. Therefore, the designer programmed functions to solve different failures, like the manager node failure. To save the bandwidth, a worker node should work on the data close to it. Additionally, the authors find that few tasks cost lots of time, and if we ignore the last few completed nodes, the time cost will reduce significantly.

After the paper is published, lots of organizations involved into in this field. Due to the development of Hadoop, Apache became famous in this area. Facebook is a main contributer to Hadoop, Twitter has Rainbird, etc. But we have to say, these ideas all rely on Google's paper and also some paper from Amazon invoved.
